    <ul>
  <li>The problem of searching for patterns in data is fundamental one and has a long and successful history.</li>
  <li>The field of <strong>pattern recognition</strong> is concerned with the automatic discovery of <em>regularities in data</em> through the use of <strong>computer algorithms</strong> and with the use of these regularities to take action such as classifying the data into different categories.</li>
  <li>In mechine learning, a training set is used to tune the parameters of an adaptive model.</li>
  <li>In most applications, the original training sets are preprocessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve
    <ul>
      <li>this pre-processing stage is sometimes also called feature extraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="types-of-mechine-learning">Types of mechine learning:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>supervised learning
    <ul>
      <li>classification problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>unsupervised learning
    <ul>
      <li>to discover groups of similar examples within the data (clustering)</li>
      <li>determine the distribution of data within the input space (density estimation)</li>
      <li>project the data from high-dimensional space down to low dimensions for the purpose of <em>visualization</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>reinforcement learning
    <ul>
      <li>to find suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward.</li>
      <li>the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of trial and error.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="example-polynomial-curve-fitting">Example: polynomial Curve Fitting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data generated for this example:
    <ul>
      <li>sin(2\pi x) with random noise</li>
      <li>the data sets process an underlying regularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by random noise.</li>
      <li>the noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic processes such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of variability that are themselves unobserved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Training set:
    <ul>
      <li>N observations of x: X=(x1, x2, … xN)^T</li>
      <li>the corresponding observations: T= (t1, t2, …, tN)^T</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The goal is to exploit this training set in order to make prediction of the value t^ of the target variable for some new value x^ of the input variable.</li>
  <li>The values of the coefficients will be determined by fitting the polynomial to the training data.
    <ul>
      <li>This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the misfit between the function y(x,W), for any given value w, and the training set data points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The remain problem is the choosing the order M of the polynomial, and this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model comparison or modelselection.
    <ul>
      <li>More flexible polynomials with larger values of M are becoming <strong>increasingly tuned to the random noise on the target values</strong>.</li>
      <li>For a given model complexity, the over-fitting problem become less severe as the the size of the data set increase.</li>
      <li><em>the number of parameters is not necessarity the most appropriate measure of model complexity.</em></li>
      <li>The over-fitting problem can be understood as a general property of maximum likelihood.</li>
      <li>The over-fitting problem can be avoided by adopting a Bayesian approach.
        <ul>
          <li>in a Bayesian model, the <em>effective</em> number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the data set.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="probability-theory">Probability theory</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A key concept in pattern recognition is that of uncertainty:
    <ul>
      <li>noise on measurement</li>
      <li>finite size of data sets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Probability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantificaion and manipulation of uncertainty and forms one of the central fundations for pattern recognition.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It allows us to make optimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that information may be incomplete or ambiguous.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bayesian-probabilities">Bayesian probabilities</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Classsical or frequentist interpretation of probability is based on the frequencies of random, repeatable events.</li>
  <li><strong>Bayesian view</strong>: probabilities provide a quantification of uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Bayes’ theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data.</li>
  <li>The Bayesian framework has its origins in the 18th century, however, the practical application of Bayesian methods was for a long time severely limited by the difficulties in carrying through the full Bayesian procedure, particularly the need to marginalized over the whole of parameter space.</li>
