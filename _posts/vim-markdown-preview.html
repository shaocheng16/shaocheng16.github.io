<h2>data: </h2>

<h1>Extended the atomistic Green's function methods to calculate the transmission coefficient of individual phonon modes</h1>

<ul>
<li>The extended method is based on the concept of the <strong>Bloch matric</strong></li>
<li>It allow us to determine the wavelength and polarizatoin dependence of the phonon transmission</li>
</ul>

<p>'''The Atomistic Green's Function methods is based on the lattice dynamics of a finite body coupled to a semi-infinite thermal reservoir.

<ul>
<li>Lack of knowledge of phonon <em>transmission coefficients</em> between specific modes on each side of the interface and how the coefficients are affected by <strong>atomic scale structure</strong>.</li>
<li>Precise transmission and reflection processes that lead to thermal resistance and how they depend on phonon frequency as well as incident angle. 
<ul>
<li>The process can be partly explained with familiar concepts such as <strong>conservation of transverse momentum</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mode-resolved formalism of the AGF
<ul>
<li>transmission coefficient from a specific mode in a material to a specific mode in the other material. </li>
