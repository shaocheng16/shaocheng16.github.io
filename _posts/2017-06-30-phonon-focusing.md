# Phonon scattering at interfaces

  - The heat-pulse technique was first demonstrated for solids by von
    Gutfeld and Nethercot in 1964.
  - In 1969, Taylor, Maris, and Elbaum noted that for all crystals a
    large difference in the _intensities of the longitudinal and
    transverse pulses_ depended on the propagation directions. This
    effect was called *phonon focusing*.
  - Phonon focusing occurs because elastic waves in anisotropic media
    have a group velocity that in general is not parallel to the
    wavevector.
    + the direction of energy propagation is not normal to the
      wavefronts. In particular, waves with quite different k direction
      can have nearly the save Vg. So that the energy flux associated
      with those waves bunches along certain crystalline direction.
    + As a consequence of the noncollinear k and Vg, an isotropic
      distribution of wavevectors emanating from a point source of heat
      can produce a highly anisotropic distribution of energy flux.
    + Hensel and Dynes found an extreme anisotropy in the nonequilibrium
      phonon flux emanating from a point source. (measured by a narrow
      bolometer)


##  The kapitza problem

  + Kapitza's experiments in 1941, sharp temperature gradient at the
    interface of a heated solid immersed in liquid He.
  + Khalatnakov later realized that this thermal boundary resistance
    could be explained from a simple acoustic mismatch theory.
    + aoustic impedances Z= rhonu (rho is the density, nu is the speed
      of sound)
    + however, based on the acoustic impedance, he predict that the
      average transmission coefficient between solid and liquid should
      be approximately 1%, whereas the measured thermal boundary
      resistances corresponded to a transmission coefficient of
      approximately 50%.
    + [Wyatt and Page] employed ballistic heat pulses to continuous scan
      the incident angle of phonons at solid/liquid-He interface.

## solid/solid interfaces

  - total internal reflection at sepcially prepared solid/solid
    interfaces has been observed.
