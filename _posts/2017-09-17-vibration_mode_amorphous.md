# vibrations in amorphous materials
> While in crystals heat is carried by propagating lattice waves, or phonons, in amorphous solids heat carriers are classified as propagons, diffusions, and locons depending on the **degree of delocalization** of the atomic vibration and its mean free path [^fn1][^fn2]. 

> In a-Si, prior works concludeed that non-propagating waves are the dominant contributors to heat transport, while propagating waves are restricted to frequency less than a few THz and are scattered by **anharmonicity**.

Current works on the thermal transport in a-Si:
- [Heat transport in amorphous silicon: Interplay between morphology and disorder](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3574366)
    + Equilibrum molecular dynamics
- [Thermal conductivity accumulation in amorphous silica and amorphous silicon](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.144303)
    + Normal-mode analysis
    + Plane-wave-like propogation is not affected by atomic disorder
- [Examining the Validity of the Phonon Gas Model in Amorphous Materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37675)
    + phonon gas model is not applicable to amorphous materials

- propagating elastic waves dominate the thermal conduction and are scattered by elastic fluctuations rather than anharmonicity.
- explicitly demonstrate the propagating nature of vibration with frequency approaching 10 THz using a triggered wave computational experiment.
