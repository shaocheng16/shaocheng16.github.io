# [David et al.,1993, High resolution neutron powder diffraction: a case study of the structure of C60](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/442/1914/129.article-info)
- The bonding anisotropy in C60 plays a crucial role in the reorientational molecular motion and consequently the rich structural variation of crystalline C60 as a function of temperature. 
- Reorientational correlation times are around 9 ps at 280 K.
