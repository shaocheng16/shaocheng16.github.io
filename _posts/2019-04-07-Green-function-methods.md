## Working flow

1. **Harmonic matrices** for the system and its components are firstly generated, which established the harmonic relationship between any two atomic degree of freedom.
1. **Green's functions** of the system and its components are calculated from the harmonic matrices. 
2. **frequency-depdendent phonon transmission** is then generated, and integration is performed over the full frequency spectrum to get the net heat flow rate.


## Self-energy matrices

## Green's function Matrices
- The response of a dynamic matric system to an infinitesimal perturbation can be discribed by a Green's function.


### Phonon transmission function & thermal conductance
