<ul>
  <li>The heat-pulse technique was first demonstrated for solids by von
Gutfeld and Nethercot in 1964.</li>
  <li>In 1969, Taylor, Maris, and Elbaum noted that for all crystals a
large difference in the <em>intensities of the longitudinal and
transverse pulses</em> depended on the propagation directions. This
effect was called <em>phonon focusing</em>.</li>
  <li>Phonon focusing occurs because elastic waves in anisotropic media
have a group velocity that in general is not parallel to the
wavevector.
    <ul>
      <li>the direction of energy propagation is not normal to the
wavefronts. In particular, waves with quite different k direction
can have nearly the save Vg. So that the energy flux associated
with those waves bunches along certain crystalline direction.</li>
      <li>As a consequence of the noncollinear k and Vg, an isotropic
distribution of wavevectors emanating from a point source of heat
can produce a highly anisotropic distribution of energy flux.</li>
      <li>Hensel and Dynes found an extreme anisotropy in the nonequilibrium
phonon flux emanating from a point source. (measured by a narrow
bolometer)</li>

<h2 id="the-kapitza-problem">The kapitza problem</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Kapitzaâ€™s experiments in 1941, sharp temperature gradient at the
interface of a heated solid immersed in liquid He.</li>
  <li>Khalatnakov later realized that this thermal boundary resistance
could be explained from a simple acoustic mismatch theory.
    <ul>
      <li>aoustic impedances Z= rhonu (rho is the density, nu is the speed
of sound)</li>
      <li>however, based on the acoustic impedance, he predict that the
average transmission coefficient between solid and liquid should
be approximately 1%, whereas the measured thermal boundary
resistances corresponded to a transmission coefficient of
approximately 50%.</li>
      <li>[Wyatt and Page] employed ballistic heat pulses to continuous scan
the incident angle of phonons at solid/liquid-He interface.</li>
