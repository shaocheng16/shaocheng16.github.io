# Integration Algorithm
- [reference](http://www.chem.purdue.edu/slipchenko/courses/chem579/files/books/leach_ch6_md.pdf)
- The computational effort required is a major consideration in choosing which algorithm to use. 
- An algorithm that is normally more expensive (for example, requires more than one force evaluation per iteration) may permit a significantly longer time step to be used and so, in fact, may be more cost-effective. 
- One of the most important considerations is the energy conservation.
    + a variation of one part in 10^4 is generally considered acceptable.
