However, the performance of carbon nanotube based thermal interface material is strongly limited by the small effective contact area and weak bonding at carbon nanotube and material interface. Here, we propose a junction structure that the carbon nanotube is bonded with a monolayer graphene, which could potentially enhance the interface thermal conductance. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the interface thermal conductance can be enhanced by at least 40\% compared to direct carbon nanotube and silicon interface with strong covalent bonding, while for weak van der Waals bonding the conductance can be enhanced by almost one order of magnitude. The enhancement of thermal conductance is attributed to the efficient thermal transport between carbon nanotube and graphene, as well as the good contact between graphene and silicon surface.},

	abstract = {One way to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of solids is to induce additional phonon–surface scattering through nanostructures. However, the way in which phonons interact with surfaces, especially at the atomic level, is not well understood at present. In this work, we perform two-dimensional atomistic wave-packet simulations to investigate angular-resolved phonon reflection at a surface. Different surface morphologies, including smooth surfaces, periodically rough surfaces, and surfaces with amorphous coatings, are considered. For a smooth surface, mode conversion can occur after reflection, with the resulting wave-packet energy distribution depending on the surface condition and the polarization of the incident phonon. At a periodically rough surface, the reflected wave-packet distribution does not follow the well-known Ziman model but shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the depth of the surface roughness. When an amorphous layer is attached to a smooth surface, the incident wave packet is absorbed by the amorphous region and is then reflected diffusively at the surface. Our results show that the commonly adopted specular-diffusive model is insufficient to describe phonon reflection at a periodically rough surface and that an amorphous layer can induce strong diffusive reflection. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of phonon reflection at different types of surfaces, which is important for better understanding of thermal transport in various nanostructures.},

	abstract = {Due to their exceptional electrical, thermal, and optical properties, low-dimensional (LD) materials are very promising for many applications, such as nanoelectronic devices, energy storage, energy conversion, and thermal management. The thermal performance of LD materials is often an important consideration in these applications. Although freestanding LD materials exhibit interesting thermal properties, they are almost never used in such a form. Instead, they are often integrated into a certain environment; for example, in a composite material or on a substrate. Due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of LD materials, the environment usually has a strong impact on the thermal transport properties of these materials. The thermal behavior of the LD materials can be completely different from the freestanding form. The effect of environmental perturbation on thermal transport properties has recently attracted a lot of research interest. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of how the typical external perturbations, including tensile strain, substrate, and clustering, can affect the thermal transport properties of LD materials. Emphasis will be placed on how these perturbations affect the lattice structure, phonon dispersion, lattice anharmonicity, and thermal conductivity. We will also summarize the achievements and the remaining challenges on this research topic.},

In the full DOF model, all DOF are active. In the rigid body model, the intramolecular DOF are frozen, such that only center of mass (COM) translations and molecular rotations/librations are active. In the point mass model, the molecule is replaced by a point mass, such that only COM translations are active. The zero-pressure lattice constants and bulk moduli predicted from the three models fall within ranges of 0.15 and 20\%. The thermal conductivity of the point mass model is the largest across the temperature range, showing a crystal-like temperature dependence (i.e., it decreases with increasing temperature) due to the presence of phonon modes associated with the COM translations. The rigid body model thermal conductivity is the smallest and follows two distinct regimes. It is crystal-like at low temperatures and becomes temperature invariant at high temperatures. The latter is typical of the behavior of an amorphous material. By calculating the rotational diffusion coefficient, the transition between the two regimes is found to occur at the temperature where the molecules begin to rotate freely. Above this temperature, phonons related to COM translations are scattered by the rotational DOF. The full DOF model thermal conductivity is larger than that of the rigid body model, indicating that intramolecular DOF contribute to thermal transport.},

	abstract = {Phonon surface scattering is of great importance for understanding thermal transport in nanostructured materials and has been widely utilized to tailor thermal properties. However, the current understanding of phonon surface scattering is largely based on the Ziman's formula which was derived at the continuum limit of the scalar wave equation and, thus, ignoring the atomistic information of the surface. In this work, we applied the atomistic phonon wave-packet simulations to study the impact of surface amorphization and surface roughness on phonon reflection. We found that for both types of surfaces, the energies of the specularly reflected components decrease with increasing wavelength. However, the underlying reflection mechanisms are different. For the amorphous surface, the energy of the incident wave packet will first enter the amorphous layer before being partially and diffusely scattered in this layer. The local density and elastic moduli fluctuations as well as the localized vibrational modes are reasons for the diffuse scattering in the amorphous region, which affects the short wavelength phonons more severely. For the rough surface, the diffuse reflection is the combined effect from surface irregularity, surface Rayleigh waves, and spatially localized modes induced by the surface roughness. The extent of diffuse reflection at the rough surface can be tuned by engineering the surface boundary condition.},

The sample was synthesized by high-pressure torsion with a nominal pressure of 24 GPa.

The measured thermal conductivities of the sample in the temperature range of 150–330 K are on the order of 5 W/(m K) and exhibit weak temperature dependence. A multiscale modeling that incorporates first-principles lattice dynamics, the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method, and effective medium theory was used to understand the mechanism of phonon transport in multiphase nanostructured silicon as well as the weak temperature dependence.

Beyond 2 nm from the wall, the density profile and in-plane diffusion coefficients recover their bulk values. The channel-averaged in-plane diffusion coefficients increase monotonically with wall separation and recover the bulk values at a separation of 15 nm. A simple semianalytical model is proposed that mirrors this trend.

The enhancement was first systematically confirmed on a model interface system by detailed SAM morphology characterization and TBC measurements. TBC significantly depends on the SAM coverage and ordering, and the formation of high-quality SAM promoted the TBC to 73 MW/m2-K from 27 MW/m2-K, the value without SAM. With the help of molecular dynamics simulations, the TBC enhancement was identified to be determined by the number of SAM bridges and the overlap of vibrational density of states. The diamond particles of 210 μm in size were simultaneously functionalized by SAM with the condition giving the highest TBC in the model system and sintered together with the copper to fabricate isotropic copper/diamond composite of 50\% volume fraction. The measured thermal conductivity marked 711 W/m-K at room temperature, the highest value among the ones with similar diamond-particles volume fraction and size.

	abstract = {Thermal boundary conductance is typically positively correlated with interfacial adhesion at the interface. Here, we demonstrate a counterintuitive experimental result in which a weak van der Waals interface can give a higher thermal boundary conductance than a strong covalently bonded interface. This occurs in a system with highly mismatched vibrational frequencies (copper/diamond) modified by a self-assembled monolayer. Using finely controlled fabrication and detailed characterization, complemented by molecular simulation, the effects of bridging the vibrational spectrum mismatch and bonding at the interface are systematically varied and understood from a molecular dynamics viewpoint. The results reveal that the bridging and binding effects have a trade-off relationship and, consequently, that the bridging can overwhelm the binding effect at a highly mismatched interface. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of phonon transport at interfaces, unifying physical and chemical understandings, and allowing interfacial tailoring of the thermal transport in various material systems.
Thermal conductance at interface with weak van der Waals bonding can become larger than that with strong covalent bonding.

	abstract = {In this work, we report a mechanism of stop-band formation in a multilayer array of germanium nanoparticles embedded in a crystalline silicon matrix. When only a single layer of nanoparticles is embedded, the local resonance, induced by the destructive interference between two different phonon wave paths, gives rise to several sharp and significant transmittance dips. On the other hand, when the number of the layers of embedded nanoparticles further increases to ten, a stop band with complete phonon reflection is formed due to the two-path resonance Bragg-type phonon interference. The wave packet simulations further uncover that the stop band originates from the collective phonon resonances in the embedded nanoparticles layers. Compared with the traditional stop-band formation mechanism that is the single-path Bragg reflection, the two-path phonon-interference resonance mechanism has a significant advantage in not requiring the strict periodicity in the embedded nanoparticles multilayer array. We also demonstrate that the stop band can significantly suppress thermal conductance in the low-frequency regime. Our work provides a robust, scalable, and easily modulable stop-band formation mechanism, which opens a degree of freedom for phononics-related heat control.},

Toward the ultimate goal of designing small thermal-conductivity materials at room temperature, herein we investigate the controllability of coherent phonon transport in vdW graphene-MoS2 heterostructures with different stacking orders using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Using Bayesian optimization–based materials informatics, the optimal stacking order of graphene and MoS2 is efficiently identified from tens of thousands of candidates with varying degrees of phonon localization. The obtained thermal conductivity of the optimized heterostructure (0.026 W/m-K) is significantly lower than that of its building blocks (pristine MoS2 and graphene). Additionally, the optimized heterostructure has a thermal conductivity lower than those of representative low thermal conductivity solid materials (amorphous and disordered crystals), and the amorphous polymers. The underlying physical mechanism of coherent phonon localization is uncovered by calculating the phonon transmission in the optimum heterostructure and analyzing the histogram distribution pattern of the phonon transmissions in different disordered stacking heterostructures. The presence of localization is further validated by a comparative study of the optimum heterostructure to pristine graphene with introduced defects, changed the thickness and temperature of the system. Our work provides insight into the coherent phonons transport behavior in the atomistically smooth vdW structure, which is essential for further development of phononics.},

	abstract = {Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is widely used as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to reduce heat transfer between hot gases and metallic components in gas-turbine engines. Porous structure can generally reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk material, so porous YSZ can be potentially used as TBCs with better thermal performance. In this work, we investigate the thermal conductivity of nanoporous YSZ using the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation, and comprehensively discuss the effects of cross-sectional area, pore size, structure length, porosity, Y2O3 concentration and temperature on the thermal conductivity. To compare with the results of the NEMD simulation, we solve the heat diffusion equation and the gray Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to calculate the thermal conductivity of the same porous structure. From the results, we find that the thermal conductivity of YSZ has a weak dependence on the structure length at the length range from 10 to 26 nm, which indicates that the majority of heat carriers have very short mean free path (MFP) but there exists small percentage (about 3\%) of phonons with longer MFP (larger than 10 nm) contributing to the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity predicted by NEMD simulation is smaller than that of solving heat diffusion equation (diffusive limit) with the same porous structure. It shows that the presence of pores affects phonon scattering and further affects the thermal conductivity of nanoporous YSZ. The results agree well with the solution of gray BTE with a average MFP of 0.6 nm. The thermal conductivity of nanoporous YSZ weakly depends on the Y2O3 concentration and temperature, which shows the phonons with very short MFP play the major contribution to the thermal conductivity. The results help to better understand the heat transfer in porous YSZ structure and develop better TBCs.},

	abstract = {Asymmetrical nanostructures are leading candidates to create efficient thermal rectifiers critical in thermal management and energy conversion systems. Due to their nanoscale size and inherent non-equilibrium nature, their working principles are commonly elucidated through non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations. Using asymmetrical carbon nanotubes, the resulting thermal rectification under different heat baths is found to differ in magnitude and direction. We find that nanotubes with the Langevin baths have a higher thermal conductivity in one heat flow direction due to the low-frequency phonons, resulting in a positive rectification. On the other hand, nanotubes with the Nose-Hoover baths show similar thermal conductivity contributions in both heat flow directions across the whole phonon frequency range, culminating in a negative rectification. Our work highlights how asymmetrical carbon nanostructures can rectify heat flow differently under different heat baths and provides strong evidence for the need to consider their non-equilibrium phonon spectrum before analyzing any associated nanoscale thermal transport phenomena.},

	abstract = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) superlattice, which is made of inorganic cores and can self-assemble into various types of lattice structures, finds promising applications in optical, electrical, and optoelectronic devices. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurement [NAT. COMMUN. 10:4236 (2019)] showed that the inter-quantum-dot vibrational frequencies can be tuned by varying the QDs shapes and ligand types, suggesting that the QDs superlattices can be a platform for phonon engineering. In this work, we quantify the impact of the second periodicity on thermal transport through full-scale molecular dynamics simulations of PbS QDs superlattice with realistic QD size and ligand morphology. The vibrational pattern analysis reveals that the vibrations can be classified into the inter-QDs coherent modes and the spatially localized modes arising from the geometry confinement. The spectral analysis indicates that spatially localized modes in the frequency range of 0.8–5 THz dominate the thermal transport and lead to an amorphous-like temperature dependence between 200 and 400 K. On the other hand, the inter-QDs coherent modes, albeit have an averaged relaxation of 10 ps, have a limited thermal conductivity value of 0.01 W/mK at room temperature due to the scarce of the vibrational states. We demonstrate that controlling the ligand morphology is more efficient than tuning the second periodicity in engineering the thermal conductivity of QDs superlattice.},

	abstract = {P-TRANS is a software to simulate phonon transport in arbitrary nanostructures based on the Boltzmann transport theory. The core part of the software is a Monte Carlo ray-tracing solver that uses the stochastic method to sample phonon transport in various nanostructures. The solver is written in FORTRAN with well-organized modules and utilizing the OpenMP and MPI parallelization to achieve high performance. The software can handle a typical calculation of nanostructures with a feature size of ∼1000 nm on a normal PC within seconds, which is useful when exploring the wide variety of structures, for instance for structural optimization or high-throughput screening in material informatics. The software takes the bulk phonon properties obtained from the first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations as inputs. The database of bulk phonon properties is available on the software webpage, which currently contains more than 60 materials and will increase in the future. We also provide a graphical user interface to design the nanostructures and to run the simulation for non-expert users. In this paper, we introduce the theoretical background, the technical details and implementation, and the applications of the software.

	abstract = {Proper consideration of anharmonicity is important for the calculation of thermal conductivity. However, how the anharmonicity influences the thermal conduction in amorphous materials is still an open question. In this work, we uncover the role of anharmonicity on the thermal conductivity of amorphous silica (a−SiO2) by comparing the thermal conductivity predicted from the harmonic theory and the anharmonic theory. Moreover, we explore the effect of anharmonicity-induced frequency shift on the prediction of thermal conductivity. It is found that the thermal conductivity calculated by the recently developed anharmonic theory (quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo approximation) is higher than that calculated by the harmonic theory developed by Allen and Feldman. The use of anharmonic vibrational frequencies also leads to a higher thermal conductivity compared with that calculated using harmonic vibrational frequencies. The anharmonicity-induced frequency shift is a mechanism for the positive temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of a−SiO2 at higher temperatures. Further investigation on the mode diffusivity suggests that although anharmonicity has a larger influence on locons than diffusons, the increase in thermal conductivity due to anharmonicity is mainly contributed by the anharmonicity-induced increase of the diffusivity of diffusons. Finally, it is found that the cross-correlations between diffusons and diffusons contribute most to the thermal conductivity of a−SiO2, and the locons contribute to the thermal conductivity mainly through collaboration with diffusons. These results offer new insights into the nature of the thermal conduction in a−SiO2.},
